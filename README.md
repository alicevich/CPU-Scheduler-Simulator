CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
=======================

This program displays a simulation run of a CPU Scheduling algorithm
based on user's input for command line arguments. 

Calculations for CPU utilization, average waiting time, and worst-case waiting time
are displayed at the end of each run. 

Test files contain data inputs: process Id, arrival time, burst time, priority
Sample output for test1.txt:
	Time 0 Process 1
	Time 7 Process 3
	Time 8 Process 4
	Time 11 Process 2
	CPU Utilization: 100%
	Average waiting  time: 3.75
	Worst-case waiting time: 9

SJF  - Shortest Job First 
SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First
NP   - Non-Preemptive Priority
PP   - Preemptive Priority
